        <ul>
        1<h3>Verse 1:<br></h3>
        Loving and fighting, accusing, denying
        I can't imagine a world with you gone
        The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of
        I'd be so lost if you left me alone
        <br>You locked yourself in the bathroom
        Lying on the floor when I break through
        I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
        Can you hear me screaming? Please don't leave me
        Hold on, I still want you
   
		
		
				
		<h3><br>Chorus:</br></h3>
		
		Come back, I still need you
		Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
		I swear to love you all my life
		Hold on, I still need you
		Long endless highway, you're silent beside me
		Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
		Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading
		Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones
		They took you away on a table
		I pace back and forth as you lay still
		They pull you in to feel your heartbeat
		Can you hear me screaming? Please don't leave me
	
		
		
		<h3><br>Verse 2:</br></h3>
		Hold on, I still want you
		Come back, I still need you
		Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
		I swear to love you all my life
		Hold on, I still need you
		I don't wanna let go
		I know I'm not that strong
		I just wanna hear you
		Saying, "Baby, let's go home"
		Let's go home
		Yeah, I just wanna take you home
		Hold on, I still want you
		Come back, I still need you
